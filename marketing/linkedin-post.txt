🚀 Just launched: AIDC Barcode Toolkit for Claude Code

After 5+ years deploying barcode systems for 50+ clients (warehouses, hospitals, manufacturers), I built the developer tool I wish existed.

Problem: Barcode generation is unnecessarily complex for developers. GS1 compliance is confusing. Thermal printer integration is painful. Every project reinvents the wheel.

Solution: Natural language barcode generation in Claude Code.

✅ Generate EAN-13, UPC-A, Code 128, QR codes in seconds
✅ GS1 validation & parsing (healthcare/retail compliant)
✅ Thermal printer support (Zebra, Honeywell, Datalogic)
✅ Just ask Claude - no complex commands
✅ Zero configuration required

Example:
You: "Generate barcodes for products SKU001, SKU002, SKU003"
Claude: ✅ Done. 3 Code 128 barcodes ready for printing.

That's it.
