Title: [Show HN] Professional barcode generator for Claude Code - built by AIDC expert with 50+ deployments

Body:

Hey everyone! 👋

I just launched AIDC Barcode Toolkit for Claude Code and would love your feedback.

**What it does:**
Generate production-ready barcodes (EAN-13, UPC-A, Code 128, QR codes) using natural language in Claude Code.

**Why I built it:**
After 5+ years deploying barcode systems for warehouses, hospitals, and manufacturers across Kenya/East Africa, I kept seeing the same problem: developers struggle with:
- GS1 compliance (check digits, Application Identifiers)
- Thermal printer integration (Zebra ZPL, ESC/POS)
- Format selection (EAN vs UPC vs Code 128?)

**Example usage:**
```
You: "Generate barcodes for products ABC001, ABC002, ABC003"
Claude: ✅ Generated 3 Code 128 barcodes
```

That's it. No configuration, no complex APIs, just works.

**Tech details:**
- Node.js with jsbarcode, qrcode, bwip-js
- MIT licensed
- Supports all major formats
- GTIN validation with GS1 check digits
- Thermal printer templates (ZPL, ESC/POS, TSPL)

**Real-world testing:**
Validated with Honeywell, Zebra, Datalogic scanners from actual deployments. I'm Honeywell Partner of the Year and Zebra RFID certified.

Would appreciate:
- Feedback on the approach
- Bug reports if you test it
- Feature requests
- Stars if you find it useful ⭐

**Background:**
I'm Joseph Rwanda, Technical Solutions Architect at Origami Tech. Featured in Floriculture Magazine for AIDC innovation. This plugin represents 5+ years of real-world experience, not theoretical knowledge.

Happy to answer questions!

P.S. If you're building warehouse/inventory/retail systems and need barcodes, this might save you weeks of work.
