After 5 years deploying barcode systems, I built the tool I wish existed.

Example:
"Generate barcodes for SKU001, SKU002, SKU003"
✅ Done. That simple.

Features:
• All major formats (EAN-13, UPC-A, Code 128, QR)
• GTIN validation with check digits
• GS1 parsing (healthcare/retail compliant)
• Zebra/Honeywell/Datalogic printer support
• Natural language interface
• MIT licensed

Built by someone who's actually debugged Zebra printers at 2AM in warehouses. 😅

⭐ Star if useful!
