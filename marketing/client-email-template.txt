Subject: New Developer Tool: Generate Barcodes Instantly (Free)

Hi [Client Name],

Quick update - I just launched a free tool that might help your development team.

**AIDC Barcode Toolkit for Claude Code**
https://github.com/rmjoe99/aidc-barcode-toolkit

It makes barcode generation as simple as asking:
"Generate a barcode for product ABC123"

Done. That's it.

Features based on our work together:
✅ All formats (EAN-13, UPC-A, Code 128, QR codes)
✅ GS1 validation (like we implemented for your system)
✅ Thermal printer support (Zebra, Honeywell, Datalogic)
✅ Natural language - no complex commands
✅ Zero configuration required

Built from 5+ years experience (including your deployment) to solve the problems developers actually face.

Free & open source. MIT licensed.

**Perfect for:**
- New features in your existing system
- Rapid prototyping
- Developer onboarding
- Label generation automation

**Quick demo:**
